\section{Introduction}
Given a sequence of partially observed states, this paper formalizes the task of computing the {\em least-commitment} action model that is able to {\em explain} the given observation. This task is of interest because it allows the incremental learning of action models from arbitrary large sets of partial observations.

In addition, the paper introduces a new method to compute the {\em least-commitment} action model from a sequence of partially observed states. The method assumes that action models are specified as \strips\ action schemata and it is built on top of off-the-shelf algorithms for {\em conformant planning}.



\section{Background}
This section formalizes the planning models we use in the paper as well as the kind of observations that are given as input for the computation of the {\em least-commitment} action model.  

\subsection{Classical planning with conditional effects}
Let $F$ be the set of {\em fluents} or {\em state variables} (propositional variables). A {\em literal} $l$ is a valuation of a fluent $f\in F$, i.e. either~$l=f$ or $l=\neg f$. $L$ is a set of literals that represents a partial assignment of values to fluents, and $\mathcal{L}(F)$ is the set of all literals sets on $F$, i.e.~all partial assignments of values to fluents. A {\em state} $s$ is a full assignment of values to fluents. We explicitly include negative literals $\neg f$ in states s.t. $|s|=|F|$ and the size of the state space is $2^{|F|}$.

A {\em classical planning frame} is a tuple $\Phi=\tup{F,A}$, where $F$ is a set of fluents and $A$ is a set of \emph{actions}. An action $a\in A$ is defined with {\em preconditions}, $\pre(a)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, {\em positive effects}, $\eff^+(a)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, and {\em negative effects} $\eff^-(a)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$. The semantics of actions $a\in A$ is specified with two functions: $\rho(s,a)$ denotes whether action $a$ is {\em applicable} in a state $s$ and $\theta(s,a)$ denotes the {\em successor state} that results of applying action $a$ in a state $s$. Then, $\rho(s,a)$ holds iff $\pre(a)\subseteq s$. And the result of applying $a$ in $s$ is $\theta(s,a)=\{s\setminus\eff^-(a))\cup\eff^+(a)\}$.

A {\em classical planning problem} is a tuple $P=\tup{F,A,I,G}$, where $I$ is the initial state and $G\in\mathcal{L}(F)$ is the set of goal conditions over the state variables. A {\em plan} $\pi$ is an action sequence $\pi=\tup{a_1, \ldots, a_n}$, with $|\pi|=n$ denoting its {\em plan length}. The execution of $\pi$ on the initial state $I$ of $P$ induces a {\em trajectory} $\tau(\pi,s_0)=\tup{s_0, a_1, s_1, \ldots, a_n, s_n}$ such that $s_0=I$ and, for each {\small $1\leq i\leq n$}, it holds $\rho(s_{i-1},a_i)$ and $s_i=\theta(s_{i-1},a_i)$. A plan $\pi$ solves $P$ iff the induced {\em trajectory} $\tau(\pi,s_0)$ reaches a final state $G \subseteq s_n$, where all goal conditions are met. A solution plan is optimal iff its length is minimal.

An action $a_c\in A$ with conditional effects is defined as a set of preconditions $\pre(a_c)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$ and a set of {\em conditional effects} $\cond(a_c)$. Each conditional effect $C\rhd E\in\cond(a_c)$ is composed of two sets of literals: $C\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, the {\em condition}, and $E\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, the {\em effect}. An action $a_c$ is applicable in a state $s$ if $\rho(s,a_c)$ is true, and the {\em triggered effects} resulting from the action application are the effects whose conditions hold in $s$:
\[
triggered(s,a_c)=\bigcup_{C\rhd E\in\cond(a_c),C\subseteq s} E,
\]

The result of applying action $a_c$ in state $s$ is $\theta(s,a_c)=\{s\setminus\eff_c^-(s,a))\cup\eff_c^+(s,a)\}$, where $\eff_c^-(s,a)\subseteq triggered(s,a)$ and $\eff_c^+(s,a)\subseteq triggered(s,a)$ are, respectively, the triggered {\em negative} and {\em positive} effects.


\subsection{The observation model}
Given a classical planning problem $P=\tup{F,A,I,G}$, a plan $\pi$ and a trajectory $\tau(\pi,s_0)$, we define the \emph{observation of the trajectory} as a sequence of partial states that results from observing the execution of $\pi$ on $I$. Formally, $\mathcal{O}(\tau)=\tup{s_0^o,s_1^o \ldots , s_m^o}$ where $s_0^o=I$.

A partially observable state $s_i^o$, {\small $0<i<m$}, is one in which $|s_i^o| < |F|$; i.e., a state in which at least a fluent of $F$ is not observable. Note that this definition also comprises the case $|s_i^o| = 0$, when the state is fully unobservable. Whatever the sequence of observed states of $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ is, it must be consistent with the sequence of states of $\tau(\pi,s_0)$, meaning that $\forall i, s_i^o \subseteq s_i$. In practice, the number of observed states $m$, ranges from 1 (the initial state, at least), to $|\pi|+1$, and the observed intermediate states will comprise a number of fluents between $[1,|F|]$.

In other words, we assume there is a {\em bijective monotone mapping} between trajectories and observations~\cite{ramirez2009plan}, thus also granting the inverse consistency relationship (the trajectory is a superset of the observation). Therefore, transiting between two consecutive observed states in $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ may require the execution of more than a single action ($\theta(s_i^o,\tup{a_1,\ldots,a_k})=s_{i+1}^o$, where ${\small k\geq 1}$ is unknown but finite. In other words, having $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ does not imply knowing the actual length of $\pi$.

\begin{definition}[Explaning a $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ observation]
Given a {\em classical planning problem} $P$ and a sequence of partially observed states $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$, we say that a plan $\pi$ {\em explains the observation} (denoted $\pi\mapsto\mathcal{O}(\tau)$) iff $\pi$ is a solution for $P$ that is consistent with $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$. If $\pi$ is also optimal, we say that $\pi$ is the {\em best explanation} for $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Conformant planning}
{\em Conformant planning} is planning with incomplete information about the initial state, no sensing, and validating that goals are achieved with certainty (despite the uncertainty of the initial state)~\cite{goldman1996expressive,smith1998conformant,bonet2000planning}.

Syntactically, conformant planning problems are expressed in compact form through a set of state variables. A {\em conformant planning problem} can be defined as a tuple $P_c=\tup{F,A,\Upsilon,G}$ where $F$, $A$ and $G$ are the set of {\em fluents}, {\em actions} and {\em goals} (as previously defined for {\em classical planning}). Now $\Upsilon$ is a set of clauses over literals $l=f$ or $l=\neg f$ (for $f\in F$) that define the set of possible initial states. 

A solution to a conformant planning problem is an action sequence that maps each possible initial state into a goal state. More precisely, an action sequence $\pi=\tup{a_1, \ldots, a_n}$ is a {\em conformant plan} for $P_c$ iff, for each possible {\em trajectory} $\tau(\pi,s_0)=\tup{s_0, a_1, s_1, \ldots, a_n, s_n}$ s.t. $s_0$ is a valuation of the fluents in $F$ that satisfies $\Upsilon$, then $\tau(\pi,s_0)$ reaches a final state $G \subseteq s_n$.



\section{Computing the {\em least-commitment} action model from state observations}
First, this section formalizes the notion of the {\em least-commitment} action model that is able to {\em explain} a sequence of partially observed states. Next, the section describes our approach to compute such model via {\em conformant planning}. 

\subsection{The {\em least-commitment} action model}
The task of computing the {\em least-commitment} action model from a sequence of state observations is defined as $\tup{\Phi,\mathcal{O}(\tau)}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Phi=\tup{F,A[\cdot]}$ is a {\em classical planning frame} where $A[\cdot]$ is a set of actions s.t. the semantics of each $a\in A[\cdot]$ is unknown; i.e. the corresponding $\tup{\rho,\theta}$ functions are undefined. 
\item $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ is a sequence of partial states that results from the partial observation of a trajectory $\tau(\pi,s_0)$ that is defined within the {\em classical planning frame} $\Phi$.
\end{itemize}

Before formalizing the solution to this task, i.e. the {\em least-commitment} action model, we introduce several necessary definitions. Given a {\em classical planning frame} $\Phi=\tup{F,A[\cdot]}$ and a sequence of partial states $\mathcal{O}(\tau)=\tup{s_0^o,s_1^o \ldots , s_m^o}$, we can build the classical planning problem $P_\mathcal{O}=\tup{F,A[\cdot],s_0^o,s_m^o}$. We say that an action model $\mathcal{M}$ is a definition of the $\tup{\rho,\theta}$ functions of every action in $A[\cdot]$. Further, we say that a model $\mathcal{M}$ {\em explains} a sequence of observations $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ iff there exists a solution plan for $P_\mathcal{O}$ when the $\tup{\rho,\theta}$ functions of the actions in $P_\mathcal{O}$ are given by $\mathcal{M}$.

Now, we define a {\em partially specified action model} inspired by the notion of {\em incomplete (annotated) model}~\cite{sreedharan2018handling}.
\begin{definition}[Partially specified action model]
Given a {\em classical planning frame} $\Phi=\tup{F,A[\cdot]}$ then, a {\em partially specified action model} $M$ is a set of possible models for the actions in $A[\cdot]$ such that: (1), any model $\mathcal{M}\in M$ is a definition of the $\tup{\rho,\theta}$ functions of every action in $A[\cdot]$ and (2), for every $\mathcal{M}\in M$ the $\tup{\rho,\theta}$ functions are defined in the set of state variables $F$. (Note that if $M$ is a singleton it represents a {\em fully specified action model}).
\end{definition}

Now we are ready to define the {\em least-commitment} action model for an observation $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$.
\begin{definition}[The {\em least-commitment} action model]
Given a $\tup{\Phi,\mathcal{O}(\tau)}$ task and the {\em partially specified action model} $M$ that represents the full space of possible action models for the actions in $A[\cdot]\in \Phi$, then the {\em least-commitment} action model is another {\em partially specified action model} that represents the largest subset of models $M^*\subseteq M$ such that every model $\mathcal{M}\in M^*$ {\em explains} the input observation.
\end{definition}

\subsection{The space of \strips\ action models}
Despite previous definitions are general, this work focuses on the particular kind of action models that are specified as \strips\ action schemata. 

{\em A \strips\ action schema} $\xi$ is defined by four lists: A list of {\em parameters} $pars(\xi)$, and three list of predicates (namely $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$) that shape the kind of fluents that can appear in the {\em preconditions}, {\em negative effects} and {\em positive effects} of the actions induced from that schema. Let be $\Psi$ the set of {\em predicates} that shape the propositional state variables $F$, and a list of {\em parameters} $pars(\xi)$. The set of elements that can appear in $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$ of the \strips\ action schema $\xi$ is given by FOL interpretations of $\Psi$ over the parameters $pars(\xi)$. We denote this set of FOL interpretations as ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$. For instance, in the {\em blocksworld} the ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ set contain eleven elements for the {\small \tt stack($v_1$,$v_2$)} schemata, ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,stack}$={\small\tt\{handempty, holding($v_1$), holding($v_2$), clear($v_1$), clear($v_2$), ontable($v_1$), ontable($v_2$), on($v_1,v_1$), on($v_1,v_2$), on($v_2,v_1$), on($v_2,v_2$)\}}. 

Despite any element of ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ can {\em a priori} appear in the $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$ of schema $\xi$, the space of possible \strips\ schemata is bounded by constraints of three kinds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Syntactic constraints}. \strips\ constraints require $del(\xi)\subseteq pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)\cap add(\xi)=\emptyset$ and $pre(\xi)\cap add(\xi)=\emptyset$. Considering exclusively these syntactic constraints, the size of the space of possible \strips\ schemata is given by $2^{2\times|{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}|}$. 
\item {\em Domain-specific constraints}. One can introduce domain-specific knowledge to constrain further the space of possible schemata. For instance, in the {\em blocksworld} one can argue that {\small\tt on($v_1$,$v_1$)} and {\small\tt on($v_2$,$v_2$)} will not appear in the $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$ lists of an action schema $\xi$ because, in this specific domain, a block cannot be on top of itself. As a rule of thumb, {\it state invariants} constraining the possible states of a given planning domain belong to this second class of constraints~\cite{fox1998automatic}. 
\item {\em Observation constraints}. A sequence of state observations $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ depicts {\em semantic knowledge} that constraints further the space of possible action schemata. 
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Computing the {\em least-commitment} model via conformant planning}
Given a task $\tup{\Phi,\mathcal{O}(\tau)}$, this section shows that we can build a {\em conformant planning problem} $P_c$ whose solution induces the {\em least-commitment} action model for the input observation $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$. In more detail, we build a {\em conformant planning problem} $P_c=\tup{F_c,A_c,\Upsilon,G_c}$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The set of fluents $F_c$ extends $F$ with two new sets of fluents:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item $\{test_j\}_{1\leq j\leq m}$, indicating the state observation $s_j\in\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ where the action model is validated
      \item Fluents {\tt\small pre\_e\_$\xi$} and {\tt\small eff\_e\_$\xi$} (where $e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$) implementing a propositional encoding of the {\em preconditions}, {\em negative}, and {\em positive} effects of an action schema $\xi$. Our encoding exploits the syntactic constraint of \strips\ so, if {\tt\small pre\_e\_$\xi$} and {\tt\small eff\_e\_$\xi$} holds it means that $e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ is a negative effect in $\xi$ while if $pre\_e\_\xi$ does not hold but {\tt\small eff\_e\_$\xi$} holds, it means that $e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ is a positive effect in $\xi$. Figure~\ref{fig:propositional} shows the PDDL encoding of the {\tt\small stack(?v1,?v2)} schema and our propositional representation for this same schema.
      \end {itemize}

\begin{figure}

 \caption{\small PDDL encoding of the {\tt\small stack(?v1,?v2)} schema and our propositional representation for this same schema.}
\label{fig:propositional}
\end{figure}

      \item The set of actions $A_c$ contains now actions of three different kinds:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Actions for {\em committing} {\tt\small pre\_e\_$\xi$} fluents to a positive/negative value (similar actions are also defined for {\em committing} {\tt\small eff\_e\_$\xi$} fluents to a positive/negative value).
\begin{small}
\begin{align*}
\hspace*{7pt}\pre(\mathsf{commit\top\_pre\_e\_\xi})=&\{mode_{commit}\},\\
\cond(\mathsf{commit\top\_pre\_e\_\xi})=&\{pre\_e\_\xi\}\rhd\{pre\_e\_\xi\},\\
                                    &\{\neg pre\_e\_\xi\}\rhd\{pre\_e\_\xi\}.\\\\
\hspace*{7pt}\pre(\mathsf{commit\bot\_pre\_e\_\xi})=&\{mode_{commit}\},\\
\cond(\mathsf{commit\bot\_pre\_e\_\xi})=&\{pre\_e\_\xi\}\rhd\{\neg pre\_e\_\xi\},\\
                                    &\{\neg pre\_e\_\xi\}\rhd\{\neg pre\_e\_\xi\}.                                    
\end{align*}
\end{small}

      \item Actions for {\em validating} that committed models explain the $s_j$ observed states, {\tt\small $0\leq j< m$}.
\begin{small}
\begin{align*}
\hspace*{7pt}\pre(\mathsf{validate_{j}})=&s_j\cup\{test_{j-1}\},\\
\cond(\mathsf{validate_{j}})=&\{\emptyset\}\rhd\{\neg test_{j-1}, test_j,\\
                            &\{mode_{commit}\}\rhd\{\neg mode_{commit}, mode_{val}\}.
\end{align*}
\end{small}

      \item {\em Editable} actions whose semantics is given by the value of {\tt\small pre\_e\_$\xi$}, {\tt\small eff\_e\_$\xi$} fluents at the current state. Figure~\ref{fig:editable} shows the PDDL encoding of an {\em editable} {\tt\small stack(?v1,?v2)} schema. Note that this editable schema when the set of fluents {\tiny\tt (pre\_holding\_v1\_stack) (pre\_clear\_v2\_stack) (eff\_holding\_v1\_stack) (eff\_clear\_v2\_stack) (eff\_clear\_v1\_stack) (eff\_handempty\_stack) (eff\_on\_v1\_v2\_stack)} hold at the current state, then it behaves exactly as the original PDDL schema defined in Figure~\ref{fig:propositional}. Formally, given an operator schema $\xi\in\mathcal{M}$ its {\em editable} version is:
\begin{small}  
\begin{align*}
\hspace*{7pt}\pre(\mathsf{editable_{\xi}})=&\{pre\_e\_\xi\implies e\}_{\forall e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}}\\
\cond(\mathsf{editable_{\xi}})=&\{pre\_e\_\xi, eff\_e\_\xi\}\rhd\{\neg e\}_{\forall e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}},\\
&\{\neg pre\_e\_\xi, eff\_e\_\xi\}\rhd\{e\}_{\forall e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}}.
\end{align*}
\end{small}

\end{itemize}

\item The clauses in $\Upsilon$ comprises:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item The {\em unit clauses} given by the fluents that hold in the initial state $I=s_0$ and $mode_{commit}$ set to true.
      \item The clauses representing that the actual value of fluents {\tt\small pre\_e\_$\xi$}, {\tt\small eff\_e\_$\xi$} is unknown. In other words, that any model from the \strips\ space of models (following the previously mentioned syntactic constraints) can initially be part of the {\em least-commitment} action model. Formally, for every $\xi$ and $e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$, then $\Upsilon$ includes these two clauses:
            \begin{itemize}
            \item {\tt\small pre\_e\_$\xi$} $\vee$ {\tt\small $\neg$pre\_e\_$\xi$}.
            \item {\tt\small eff\_e\_$\xi$} $\vee$ {\tt\small $\neg$eff\_e\_$\xi$}.
            \end{itemize}
      \end{enumerate}
One can also add here clauses that encode {\em domain-specific constraints} (as mentioned in the previous section) to make the conformant planning problem easier to be solved for a specific domain. 
\item The new goals are $G_c=s_m\cup\{test_m\}$.
\end{itemize}

In fact, we do not need to compute the {\em least-commitment} action model (i.e. solve the $P_c$ conformant planning problem) from scratch for all the $\tup{s_0^o,s_1^o \ldots , s_m^o}$ observations. A more efficient approach is to compute the {\em least-commitment} action model from scratch only for the first observation, that is for $\tup{s_0^o,s_1^o}$. Then, the obtained {\em least-commitment} action model can be used as input for improving the computation of the two first observations $\tup{s_0^o,s_1^o,s_2^o}$. In other words, including the commits found in the previous step as new {\em unit clauses} in set of the {\em initial clauses} $\Upsilon$. This process is repeated until the {\em least-commitment} action model is computed  for the full sequence of state observations $\tup{s_0^o,s_1^o \ldots , s_m^o}$.
