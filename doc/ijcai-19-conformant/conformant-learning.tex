\section{Introduction}
Given the partial observation of a plan execution, this paper formalizes the task of computing the exact set of action models that are {\em conformant} with the given observation. This task is of interest because it allows to scallably learn action models from arbitrary large sets of observations generated with that models. The approach we follow for addressing this learning task is compiling it into {\em conformant planning}.


\section{Background}
This section formalizes the {\em classical} and the {\em conformant} planning models as well as the {\em observation} model we follow to observe the execution of sequential plans.
\subsection{Classical planning with conditional effects}
$F$ is the set of {\em fluents} or {\em state variables} (propositional variables). A {\em literal} $l$ is a valuation of a fluent $f\in F$, i.e. either~$l=f$ or $l=\neg f$. $L$ is a set of literals that represents a partial assignment of values to fluents, and $\mathcal{L}(F)$ is the set of all literals sets on $F$, i.e.~all partial assignments of values to fluents. A {\em state} $s$ is a full assignment of values to fluents. We explicitly include negative literals $\neg f$ in states and so $|s|=|F|$ and the size of the state space is $2^{|F|}$.

%A {\em state} $s$ is a full assignment of values to fluents and we explicitly include negative literals $\neg f$ in states; i.e. $|s|=|F|$, so the size of the state space is $2^{|F|}$. Like in PDDL~\cite{fox2003pddl2}, we assume that fluents $F$ are instantiated from a set of {\em predicates} $\Psi$. Each predicate $p\in\Psi$ has an argument list of arity $ar(p)$. Given a set of {\em objects} $\Omega$, the set of fluents $F$ is induced by assigning objects in $\Omega$ to the arguments of predicates in $\Psi$; i.e.~$F=\{p(\omega):p\in\Psi,\omega\in\Omega^{ar(p)}\}$ such that $\Omega^k$ is the $k$-th Cartesian power of $\Omega$.

A {\em planning frame} is a tuple $\Phi=\tup{F,A}$, where $F$ is a set of fluents and $A$ is a set of \emph{actions}. An action $a\in A$ is defined with {\em preconditions}, $\pre(a)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, {\em positive effects}, $\eff^+(a)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, and {\em negative effects} $\eff^-(a)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$. The semantics of actions $a\in A$ is specified with two functions: $\rho(s,a)$ denotes whether action $a$ is {\em applicable} in a state $s$ and $\theta(s,a)$ denotes the {\em successor state} that results of applying action $a$ in a state $s$. Then, $\rho(s,a)$ holds iff $\pre(a)\subseteq s$. And the result of applying $a$ in $s$ is $\theta(s,a)=\{s\setminus\eff^-(a))\cup\eff^+(a)\}$.

A {\em planning problem} is defined as a tuple $P=\tup{F,A,I,G}$, where $I$ is the initial state in which all the fluents of $F$ are assigned a value {\em true\textbar false} and $G$ is the set of goal conditions over the state variables in $F$. A {\em plan} $\pi$ for $P$ is an action sequence $\pi=\tup{a_1, \ldots, a_n}$, and $|\pi|=n$ denotes its {\em plan length}. The execution of $\pi$ in the initial state $I$ of $P$ induces a {\em trajectory} $\tau(\pi,s_0)=\tup{s_0, a_1, s_1, \ldots, a_n, s_n}$ such that $s_0=I$ and, for each {\small $1\leq i\leq n$}, it holds $\rho(s_{i-1},a_i)$ and $s_i=\theta(s_{i-1},a_i)$. A plan $\pi$ solves $P$ iff the induced {\em trajectory} $\tau(\pi,s_0)$ reaches a final state $G \subseteq s_n$.

An action $a_c\in A$ with conditional effects is defined as a set of preconditions $\pre(a_c)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$ and a set of {\em conditional effects} $\cond(a_c)$. Each conditional effect $C\rhd E\in\cond(a_c)$ is composed of two sets of literals: $C\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, the {\em condition}, and $E\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, the {\em effect}. An action $a_c$ is applicable in a state $s$ if $\rho(s,a_c)$ is true, and the {\em triggered effects} resulting from the action application are the effects whose conditions hold in $s$:
\[
triggered(s,a_c)=\bigcup_{C\rhd E\in\cond(a_c),C\subseteq s} E,
\]

The result of applying action $a_c$ in state $s$ is $\theta(s,a_c)=\{s\setminus\eff_c^-(s,a))\cup\eff_c^+(s,a)\}$, where $\eff_c^-(s,a)\subseteq triggered(s,a)$ and $\eff_c^+(s,a)\subseteq triggered(s,a)$ are, respectively, the triggered {\em negative} and {\em positive} effects.


\subsection{The observation model}
Given a planning problem $P=\tup{F,A,I,G}$, a plan $\pi$ and a trajectory $\tau(\pi,s_0)$, we define the \emph{observation of the trajectory} as an interleaved combination of actions and states that represents the observation from the execution of $\pi$ in $P$. Formally, $\mathcal{O}(\tau)=\tup{s_0^o,a_1^o,s_1^o \ldots , a_l^o, s_m^o}$, $s_0^o=I$, and:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\bf observed actions} are consistent with $\pi$, which means that $\tup{a_1^o, \ldots, a_l^o}$ is a sub-sequence of $\pi$. Specifically, the number of observed actions, $l$, can range from $0$ (fully unobservable action sequence) to $|\pi|$ (fully observable action sequence).
\item The {\bf observed states} $\tup{s_0^o, s_1^o, \ldots, s_m^o}$ is a sequence of possibly {\em partially observable states}, except for the initial state $s_0^o$, which is fully observable. A partially observable state $s_i^o$ is one in which $|s_i^o| < |F|$; i.e., a state in which at least a fluent of $F$ is not observable. Note that this definition also comprises the case $|s_i^o| = 0$, when the state is fully unobservable. Whatever the sequence of observed states of $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ is, it must be consistent with the sequence of states of $\tau(\pi,s_0)$, meaning that $\forall i, s_i^o \subseteq s_i$. In practice, the number of observed states, $m$, range from 1 (the initial state, at least), to $|\pi|+1$, and the observed intermediate states will comprise a number of fluents between $[1,|F|]$.
    %Exceptionally, $s_m^o$ cannot be fully unobservable for the purpose of our task (we will elaborate on this issue later on).
\end{itemize}

We assume a bijective monotone mapping between actions/states of trajectories and observations~\cite{ramirez2009plan}, thus also granting the inverse consistency relationship (the trajectory is a superset of the observation). Therefore, transiting between two consecutive observed states in $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ may require the execution of more than a single action ($\theta(s_i^o,\tup{a_1,\ldots,a_k})=s_{i+1}^o$, where ${\small k\geq 1}$ is unknown but finite. In other words, having $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ does not imply knowing the actual length of $\pi$.

\subsection{Conformant planning}
{\em Conformant planning} refers to planning with incomplete information about the initial situation, no sensing, and where goals are to be achieved with certainty in spite of the uncertainty in the initial situation~\cite{smith1998conformant,goldman1996expressive}.

Syntactically, conformant planning problems are expressed in compact form through a set of state variables. A {\em conformant planning problem} is defined as a tuple $P_c=\tup{F,A,\Upsilon,G}$, where $\Upsilon$ is a set of clauses over literals $l=f$ or $l=\neg f$ (for $f\in F$) that define the set of possible initial states. 

A solution to a conformant planning problem is an action sequence that maps each possible initial state into a goal state. More precisely an action sequence $\pi=\tup{a_1, \ldots, a_n}$ is a {\em conformant plan} for $P_c$ iff for each possible {\em trajectory} $\tau(\pi,s_0)=\tup{s_0, a_1, s_1, \ldots, a_n, s_n}$ such that $s_0$ is a valuation that satisfies $\Upsilon$ and it holds that the trajectory reaches $G \subseteq s_n$.

\section{Learning {\em the least commitment} action model from observations}

\subsection{The hypothesis space}
\strips\ action schemata provide a compact representation for specifying classical planning models. {\em A \strips\ action schema} $\xi$ is defined by four lists: A list of {\em parameters} $pars(\xi)$, and three list of predicates (namely $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$) that shape the kind of fluents that can appear in the {\em preconditions}, {\em negative effects} and {\em positive effects} of the actions induced from that schema.

\begin{definition}[Comparable \strips\ action schemata]
Two \strips\ schemata $\xi$ and $\xi'$ are {\bf comparable} iff $pars(\xi)=pars(\xi')$, i.e, both share the same list of parameters.\footnote{In \strips\ models, $pars(\xi)=pars(\xi')$ implies the number of parameters must be the same. For other planning models that allow object typing, the equality implies that parameters share the same type}
\end{definition}

For instance, the {\small\tt stack(?v1,?v2)} and {\small\tt unsstack(?v1,?v2)} schemata from a four operator {\em blocksworld}~\cite{slaney2001blocks} are {\em comparable} while {\small\tt stack(?v1,?v2)} and {\small\tt pickup(?v1)} are not. Last but not least, we say that two \strips\ models $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{M}'$ are {\em comparable} iff there exists a bijective function $\mathcal{M} \mapsto \mathcal{M}^*$ that maps every action schema $\xi\in\mathcal{M}$ to a comparable schemata $\xi'\in\mathcal{M'}$ and vice versa.

Let be $\Psi$ the set of {\em predicates} that shape the propositional state variables $F$, and a list of {\em parameters} $pars(\xi)$. The set of elements that can appear in $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$ of the \strips\ action schema $\xi$ is given by FOL interpretations of $\Psi$ over the parameters $pars(\xi)$. We denote this set of FOL interpretations as ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$. 

Despite any element of ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ can {\em a priori} appear in the $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$ of schema $\xi$, the space of possible \strips\ schemata is constrained by a set ${\mathcal C}$ that includes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Syntactic constraints}. \strips\ constraints require $del(\xi)\subseteq pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)\cap add(\xi)=\emptyset$ and $pre(\xi)\cap add(\xi)=\emptyset$. Considering exclusively these syntactic constraints, the size of the space of possible \strips\ schemata is given by $2^{2\times|{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}|}$. 

\item {\em Domain-specific constraints}. One can introduce domain-specific knowledge to constrain further the space of possible schemata. For instance, in a {\em blocksworld} one can claim that {\small\tt on($v_1$,$v_1$)} and {\small\tt on($v_2$,$v_2$)} will not appear in any of these lists because of the semantic of the {\tt\small on} predicate that codes which block is in top of other block. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[Well-defined \strips\ action schemata]
Given a set of {\em predicates} $\Psi$, a list of action {\em parameters} $pars(\xi)$, and set of FOL constraints ${\mathcal C}$, $\xi$ is a {\bf well-defined \strips\ action schema} iff its three lists $pre(\xi)\subseteq {\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$, $del(\xi)\subseteq{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ and $add(\xi)\subseteq{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ only contain elements in ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ and they satisfy all the constraints in ${\mathcal C}$.
\end{definition}

We say a planning model $\mathcal{M}$ is {\em well-defined} if all its \strips\ action schemata are {\em well-defined}.


\begin{enumerate}
\item[3.] {\em Observation constraints}. An observation of the execution of a plan further constraints the space of possible action schemata. This \emph{semantic knowledge} included in the observations introduce a third type of constraints, that we will call {\em observation constraints}, and that can be added to the set $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The learning task}


\subsection{Learning the least commitment models with conformant planning}
Given a \strips\ action schema $\xi$, a propositional encoding for the {\em preconditions}, {\em negative} and {\em positive} effects of that schema can be represented with fluents of the kind $[pre|del|add]\_e\_\xi$ such that $e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ is a single element from the set of interpretations of predicates $\Psi$ over the corresponding variable names $\Omega_\xi$. Figure~\ref{fig:encoding} shows the propositional encoding for the six action schema defined in Figure~\ref{fig:model-example}.

The interest of having a propositional encoding for \strips\ action schema is that, using {\em conditional effects}, it allows to compactly define {\em editable actions}. Actions whose semantics is given by the value of the $[pre|del|add]\_e\_\xi$ fluents at the current state. Given an operator schema $\xi\in\mathcal{M}$ its {\em editable} version is formalized as:
\begin{small}  
\begin{align*}
\hspace*{7pt}\pre(\mathsf{editable_{\xi}})=&\{pre\_e\_\xi\implies e\}_{\forall e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}}\\
\cond(\mathsf{editable_{\xi}})=&\{del\_e\_\xi\}\rhd\{\neg e\}_{\forall e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}},\\
&\{add\_e\_\xi\}\}\rhd\{e\}_{\forall e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}}.
\end{align*}
\end{small}

Figure~\ref{fig:editable} shows the PDDL encoding of the {\em editable} {\tt\small inc-x(?v1,?v2)} schema for robot navigation in a $n\times n$ grid (Figure~\ref{fig:model-example}). Note that this editable schema, when the fluents of Figure~\ref{fig:encoding} hold, behaves exactly as defined in Figure~\ref{fig:model-example}.
