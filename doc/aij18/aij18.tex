\begin{abstract}
  This paper presents a novel approach for learning \strips\ action models from examples of plan executions that compiles this learning task into classical planning. The compilation approach is flexible to various amount and forms of available input knowledge; the learning examples can range from a set of plans (with their corresponding initial and final states) or sequences of state observations to just a set of initial and final states (where no intermediate action or state is given). The compilation accepts also partially specified action models and can be used to validate whether the observation of a plan execution follows a given \strips\ action model, even if this model is not fully specified. What is more, the compilation is extensible to assess how well a \strips\ action model matches a given set of observations. Last but not least, the paper evaluates the performance of the compilation approach by learning action models for a wide range of classical planning domains from the International Planning Competition (IPC) and assessing the learned models with respect to (1), test sets of observations and (2), the true models.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Section1}
Besides {\em plan synthesis}~\cite{ghallab2004automated}, planning action models are also useful for {\em plan/goal recognition}~\cite{ramirez2012plan}. At both planning tasks, an automated planner is required to reason about action models that correctly and completely capture the possible world transitions~\cite{geffner:book:2013}. Unfortunately, building planning action models is complex, even for planning experts, and this knowledge acquisition task is a bottleneck that limits the potential of AI planning~\cite{kambhampati:modellite:AAAI2007}.

On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) has shown to be able to compute a wide range of different kinds of models from examples~\cite{michalski2013machine}. The application of inductive ML to the learning of \strips\ action models, the vanilla action model for planning~\cite{fikes1971strips}, is not straightforward though:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\em input} to ML algorithms (the learning/training data) usually are finite vectors encoding the value of fixed features in a given set of objects. The input for learning planning action models are observations of plan executions (where each plan possibly has a different length).
\item The {\em output} of ML algorithms usually is a scalar value (an integer, in the case of {\em classification} tasks, or a real value, in the case of {\em regression} tasks). When learning \strips\ action models the output is, for each action, the sets of preconditions, negative and positive effects, that define the possible state transitions.
\end{itemize}

Motivated by recent advances on the synthesis of different kinds of generative models with classical planning~\cite{bonet2009automatic,segovia2016hierarchical,segovia2017generating}, this paper introduces an innovative approach for learning \strips\ action models that can be defined as a classical planning compilation. A solution to the classical planning task that results from our compilation is a sequence of actions that determines the learned action model, i.e. the preconditions and effects of the target \strips\ operator schemas.

The compilation approach is appealing by itself, because leverages off-the-shelf planners and opens up a way towards \emph{bootstrapping} planning action models, enabling a planner to gradually learn/update its action model. The practicality of the compilation approach allow us to report learning results over fifteen IPC planning domains. In addition,the compilation approach presents the following features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is flexible to various amounts and forms of available input knowledge. Learning examples can range from a set of plans (with their corresponding initial and final states) or state observations to just a set of initial and final states where no intermediate state  or action is observed. Learning from state observations is a relevant advancement as, in many applications, the actual actions executed by the observed agent are not available but, instead, the resulting states can be observed. Learning action models from state observations broadens the range of application to external observers and facilitates the representation of imperfect observability, as shown in plan recognition \cite{SohrabiRU16}, as well as learning from unstructured data, like state images \cite{AsaiF18}).
\item Accepts previous knowledge about the structure of the actions in the form of partially specified action models. In the extreme, the compilation can validate whether an observed plan execution is valid for a given \strips\ action model, even if this model is not fully specified. For the training samples, we adopt a middle ground between unstructured inputs and plan traces, wherein only state observations are required.
\item Assess how well a \strips\ action model matches a given set of observations. Our compilation is extensible to accept a learned model as input besides the state observations. This extension allows us to transform the input model into a new model that induces the observations whilst assessing the amount of edition required by the input model to induce the given observations. The empirical evaluation of our learning approach is two-fold: First the learned \strips\ action models are tested with a set of state observation sequences and second, the learned models are compared to the corresponding reference model.
\end{enumerate}

Section~\ref{sec:Section2} reviews related work on learning planning action models. Section~\ref{sec:Section3} formalizes the classical planning model with {\em conditional effects} (a requirement of the proposed compilation) and the \strips\ action model (the output of the addressed learning task). Section~\ref{sec:Section4} formalizes the learning of \strips\ action models with regard to different amounts of available input knowledge. Sections describe our compilation approach for addressing the formalized learning tasks. Finally, the last sections report the data collected in a empirical evaluation, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the compilation approach and propose several opportunities for future research.



\section{Related work}
\label{sec:Section2}
Back in the 90's various systems aimed learning operators mostly via interaction with the environment. {\sc LIVE} captured and formulated observable features of objects and used them to acquire and refine operators \cite{ShenS89}. {\sc OBSERVER} updated preconditions and effects by removing and adding facts, respectively, accordingly to observations \cite{Wang95learningby}. These early works were based on lifting the observed states supported by exploratory plans or external teachers, but none provided a theoretical justification for this second source of knowledge.

More recent work on learning planning action models \cite{WalshL08} shows that although learning \strips\ operators from pure interaction with the environment requires an exponential number of samples, access to an external teacher can provide solution traces on demand.

Whilst the aforementioned works deal with full state observability,action model learning has also been studied in domains where there is partial or missing state observability. {\sf ARMS} works when no partial intermediate state is given. It defines a set of weighted constraints that must hold for the plans to be correct, and solves the weighted propositional satisfiability problem with a MAX-SAT solver~\cite{yang2007learning}. In order to efficiently solve the large MAX-SAT representations, {\sf ARMS} implements a hill-climbing method that models the actions approximately. %and so it may output an inconsistent model
{\sc SLAF} also deals with partial observability~\cite{amir:alearning:JAIR08}. Given a formula representing the initial belief state, a sequence of executed actions and the corresponding partially observed states, it builds a complete explanation of observations by models of actions through a CNF formula. The learning algorithm updates the formula of the belief state with every action and observation in the sequence. This update makes sure that the new formula represents all the transition relations consistent with the actions and observations. The formula returned at the end includes all consistent models, which can then be retrieved with additional processing.

Unlike the previous approaches, the one described in \cite{MouraoZPS12} deals with both missing and noisy predicates in the observations. An action model is first learnt by constructing a set of kernel classifiers which tolerate noise and partial observability and then \strips rules are derived from the classifiers' parameters.

{\sf LOCM} only requires the example plans as input without need for providing information about predicates or states~\cite{cresswell2013acquiring}. This makes {\sf LOCM} be most likely the learning approach that works with the least information possible. The lack of available information is addressed by LOCM by exploiting assumptions about the kind of domain model it has to generate. Particularly, it assumes a domain consists of a collection of objects (sorts) whose defined set of states can be captured by a parameterized Finite State Machine (FSM). The intuitive assumptions of {\sf LOCM}
, like the continuity of object transitions or the association of parameters between consecutive actions in the training sequence,
yield a learning model heavily reliant on the kind of domain structure. The inability of {\sf LOCM} to properly derive domain theories where the state of a sort is subject to different FSMs is later overcome by {\sf LOCM2} by forming separate FSMs, each containing a subset of the full transition set for the sort~\cite{cresswell2011generalised}. {\sf LOP} ({\sf LOCM} with Optimized Plans ~\cite{gregory2015domain}), the last contribution of the {\sf LOCM} family, addresses the problem of inducing static predicates. Because {\sf LOCM} approaches induce similar models for domains with similar structures, they face problems at generating models for domains that are only distinguished by whether or not they contain static relations (e.g. {\em blocksworld} and {\em freecell}). In order to mitigate this drawback, {\sf LOP} applies a post-processing step after the {\sf LOCM} analysis which requires additional information about the plans, namely a set of optimal plans to be used in the learning phase.

Compiling the learning of action models into classical planning is a general and flexible approach that allows to accommodate various amounts and kinds of input knowledge and opens up a path for addressing further learning and validation tasks. For instance, the example plans in $\Pi$ could be replaced or complemented by a set $\mathcal{O}$ of sequences of observations (i.e., fully or partial state observations with noisy or missing fluents~\cite{SohrabiRU16}), so learning tasks $\Lambda=\tup{\Psi,\Sigma,\mathcal{O},\Xi_0}$ could also be addressed. Furthermore, our approach seems extensible to learning other types of generative models (e.g. hierarchical models like HTN or behaviour trees), that can be more appealing than \strips\ models, since using them to compute planning solutions requires less search effort.



\section{Background}
\label{sec:Section3}
\subsection{Classical planning with conditional effects}
We use $F$ to denote the set of {\em fluents} (propositional variables) describing a state. A {\em literal} $l$ is a valuation of a fluent $f\in F$, i.e. either~$l=f$ or $l=\neg f$. A set of literals $L$ represents a partial assignment of values to fluents (without loss of generality, we will assume that $L$ does not assign conflicting values to any fluent). We use $\mathcal{L}(F)$ to denote the set of all literal sets on $F$, i.e.~all partial assignments of values to fluents.

A {\em state} $s$ is a full assignment of values to fluents, i.e. $|s|=|F|$, so the size of the state space is $2^{|F|}$. Explicitly including negative literals $\neg f$ in states simplifies subsequent definitions but often, we will abuse notation by defining a state $s$ only in terms of the fluents that are true in $s$, as is common in \strips\ planning.

A {\em classical planning frame} is a tuple $\Phi=\tup{F,A}$, where $F$ is a set of fluents and $A$ is a set of actions. An action $a\in A$ is defined with {\em preconditions}, $\pre(a)\subseteq\mathcal{L}(F)$, {\em positive effects}, $\eff^+(a)\subseteq\mathcal{L}(F)$, and {\em negative effects} $\eff^-(a)\subseteq\mathcal{L}(F)$. We say that an action $a\in A$ is {\em applicable} in a state $s$ iff $\pre(a)\subseteq s$. The result of applying $a$ in $s$ is the {\em successor state} denoted by $\theta(s,a)=\{s\setminus\eff^-(a))\cup\eff^+(a)\}$.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\pre(a)\subseteq\mathcal{L}(F)$, called {\em preconditions}, the literals that must hold for the action $a\in A$ to be applicable.
%\item $\eff^+(a)\subseteq\mathcal{L}(F)$, called {\em positive effects}, that defines the fluents set to true by the application of the action $a\in A$.
%\item $\eff^-(a)\subseteq\mathcal{L}(F)$, called {\em negative effects}, that defines the fluents set to false by the action application.
%\end{itemize}


An action $a\in A$ with conditional effects is defined as a set of {\em preconditions} $\pre(a)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$ and a set of {\em conditional effects} $\cond(a)$. Each conditional effect $C\rhd E\in\cond(a)$ is composed of two sets of literals $C\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, the {\em condition}, and $E\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, the {\em effect}. An action $a\in A$ is {\em applicable} in a state $s$ if and only if $\pre(a)\subseteq s$, and the {\em triggered effects} resulting from the action application are the effects whose conditions hold in $s$:
\[
triggered(s,a)=\bigcup_{C\rhd E\in\cond(a),C\subseteq s} E,
\]

The result of applying action $a$ in state $s$ is the {\em successor} state $\theta(s,a)=\{s\setminus\eff_c^-(s,a))\cup\eff_c^+(s,a)\}$ where $\eff_c^-(s,a)\subseteq triggered(s,a)$ and $\eff_c^+(s,a)\subseteq triggered(s,a)$ are, respectively, the triggered {\em negative} and {\em positive} effects.


A {\em classical planning problem} is a tuple $P=\tup{F,A,I,G}$, where $I$ is an initial state and $G\subseteq\mathcal{L}(F)$ is a goal condition. A {\em plan} for $P$ is an action sequence $\pi=\tup{a_1, \ldots, a_n}$ that induces the {\em state trajectory} $\tup{s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_n}$ such that $s_0=I$ and, for each {\small $1\leq i\leq n$}, $a_i$ is applicable in $s_{i-1}$ and generates the successor state $s_i=\theta(s_{i-1},a_i)$. The {\em plan length} is denoted with $|\pi|=n$ . A plan $\pi$ {\em solves} $P$ iff $G\subseteq s_n$, i.e.~if the goal condition is satisfied at the last state reached after following the application of the plan $\pi$ in the initial state $I$.


\subsection{\strips\ action schemas}
This work addresses the learning of PDDL action schemas that follow the \strips\ requirement~\cite{mcdermott1998pddl,fox2003pddl2}. Figure~\ref{fig:stack} shows the {\em stack} action schema, coded in PDDL, from a four-operator {\em blocksworld}~\cite{slaney2001blocks}.

To formalize the output of the learning task, we assume that fluents $F$ are instantiated from a set of {\em predicates} $\Psi$, as in PDDL. Each predicate $p\in\Psi$ has an argument list of arity $ar(p)$. Given a set of {\em objects} $\Omega$, the set of fluents $F$ is induced by assigning objects in $\Omega$ to the arguments of predicates in $\Psi$, i.e.~$F=\{p(\omega):p\in\Psi,\omega\in\Omega^{ar(p)}\}$ s.t. $\Omega^k$ is the $k$-th Cartesian power of $\Omega$.

Let $\Omega_v=\{v_i\}_{i=1}^{\operatorname*{max}_{a\in A} ar(a)}$ be a new set of objects ($\Omega\cap\Omega_v=\emptyset$), denoted as {\em variable names}, and that is bound by the maximum arity of an action in a given planning frame. For instance, in a three-block {\em blocksworld} $\Omega=\{block_1, block_2, block_3\}$ while $\Omega_v=\{v_1, v_2\}$ because the operators with the maximum arity, {\small\tt stack} and {\small\tt unstack}, have arity two. We define $F_v$, a new set of fluents s.t. $F\cap F_v=\emptyset$, that results from instantiating $\Psi$ using only the objects in $\Omega_v$ and defines the elements that can appear in an action schema. For the {\em blocksworld}, $F_v$={\small\tt\{handempty, holding($v_1$), holding($v_2$), clear($v_1$), clear($v_2$), ontable($v_1$), ontable($v_2$), on($v_1,v_1$), on($v_1,v_2$), on($v_2,v_1$), on($v_2,v_2$)\}}.

We assume also that actions $a\in A$ are instantiated from \strips\ operator schemas $\xi=\tup{head(\xi),pre(\xi),add(\xi),del(\xi)}$ where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $head(\xi)=\tup{name(\xi),pars(\xi)}$, is the operator {\em header} defined by its name and the corresponding {\em variable names}, $pars(\xi)=\{v_i\}_{i=1}^{ar(\xi)}$. The headers of a four-operator {\em blocksworld} are {\small\tt pickup($v_1$), putdown($v_1$), stack($v_1,v_2$)} and {\small\tt unstack($v_1,v_2$)}.
\item The preconditions $pre(\xi)\subseteq F_v$, the negative effects $del(\xi)\subseteq F_v$, and the positive effects $add(\xi)\subseteq F_v$ such that, $del(\xi)\subseteq pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)\cap add(\xi)=\emptyset$ and $pre(\xi)\cap add(\xi)=\emptyset$.
\end{itemize}


Finally, given the set of predicates $\Psi$ and the header of a \strips\ operator schema $\xi$, we define $F_v(\xi)\subseteq F_v$ as the subset of elements that can appear in the action schema $\xi$ and that confine its space of possible action models. For instance, for the {\em stack} action schema $F_v({\tt stack})=F_v$ while $F_v({\tt pickup})$={\small\tt\{handempty, holding($v_1$), clear($v_1$), ontable($v_1$), on($v_1,v_1$)\}} excludes the fluents from $F_v$ that involve $v_2$ because the action header {\small\tt pickup($v_1$)} contains the single parameter $v_1$.

\section{Learning \strips\ action models}
\label{sec:Section4}
Learning \strips\ action models from fully available input knowledge, i.e. from plans where the {\em pre-} and {\em post-states} of every action in a plan are available, is straightforward. When any intermediate state is available, \strips\ operator schemes are derived lifting the literals that change between the pre and post-state of the corresponding action executions. Preconditions are derived lifting the minimal set of literals that appears in all the pre-states of the corresponding actions~\cite{jimenez2012review}.

This section formalizes more challenging learning tasks, where less input knowledge is available:

\subsubsection{Learning from (initial, final) state pairs.} This learning task corresponds to observing an agent acting in the world but watching only the result of its plan executions. No intermediate information about the actions in the plans is given. This learning task is formalized as $\Lambda=\tup{\Psi,\Sigma}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Psi$ is the set of predicates that define the abstract state space of a given planning domain.
\item $\Sigma=\{\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_{\tau}\}$ is a set of $(initial, final)$ state pairs, that we call {\em labels}. Each label $\sigma_t=(s_0^t,s_{n}^t)$, {\tt\small $1\leq t\leq \tau$}, comprises the {\em final} state $s_{n}^t$ resulting from executing an unknown plan $\pi_t=\tup{a_1^t, \ldots, a_n^t}$ starting from the {\em initial} state $s_0^t$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Learning from labeled plans.}
Here we augment the input knowledge with the actions executed by the observed agent and define the learning task $\Lambda'=\tup{\Psi,\Sigma,\Pi}$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\Pi=\{\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_{\tau}\}$ is a given set of example plans where each plan $\pi_t=\tup{a_1^t, \ldots, a_n^t}$, {\small $1\leq t\leq \tau$}, is an action sequence that induces the corresponding state sequence $\tup{s_0^t, s_1^t, \ldots, s_n^t}$ such that, for each {\small $1\leq i\leq n$}, $a_i^t$ is applicable in $s_{i-1}^t$ and generates $s_i^t=\theta(s_{i-1}^t,a_i^t)$.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:lexample} shows an example of a {\em blocksworld} learning task $\Lambda'$. This learning task has a single learning example, $\Pi=\{\pi_1\}$ and $\Sigma=\{\sigma_1\}$, that corresponds to observing the execution of an eight-action plan $(|\pi_1|=8)$ for inverting a four-block tower.

\subsubsection{Learning from partially specified action models.}
We may not require to start learning from scratch so we augment the learning input with partially specified operator schemes. This leaning task is defined as $\Lambda''=\tup{\Psi,\Sigma,\Pi,\Xi_0}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Xi_0$ is a partially specified action model, i.e. some preconditions and effects are a priori known.
\end{itemize}

A solution to $\Lambda$ is a set of operator schema $\Xi$ that is compliant with the predicates in $\Psi$, and the given set of initial and final states $\Sigma$. In this learning scenario, a solution must not only determine a possible \strips\ action model but also the plans $\pi_t$, {\tt\small $1\leq t\leq \tau$} that explain the given labels $\Sigma$ using the learned \strips\ model. A solution to $\Lambda'$ is a set of \strips\ operator schema $\Xi$ (one schema $\xi=\tup{head(\xi),pre(\xi),add(\xi),del(\xi)}$ for each action with a different name in the example plans $\Pi$) compliant with the predicates $\Psi$, the example plans $\Pi$, and their corresponding labels $\Sigma$.  Finally a solution to $\Lambda''$ is a set of \strips\ operator schema $\Xi$ compliant as well with the provided partially specified action model $\Xi_0$.

%Learning \strips\ action models from plans where every action in the plan is available, as well as its corresponding {\em pre-} and {\em post-states}, is straightforward. In this case, \strips\ operator schemes are derived lifting the literals that change between the pre and post-state of the corresponding action executions. Preconditions are derived lifting the minimal set of literals that appears in all the corresponding pre-states.

This paper addresses the learning task that corresponds to observing an agent acting in the world but watching only the results of its plan executions, the actual executed actions are unobserved. This learning task is defined as $\Lambda=\tup{\mathcal{M},\Psi,\mathcal{O}}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of {\em empty} operator schemas, wherein each $\xi\in\mathcal{M}$ is only composed of $head(\xi)$.
\item $\Psi$ is the set of predicates, that define the abstract state space of a given classical planning frame.
\item $\mathcal{O}=\tup{s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_{n}}$ is a sequence of {\em state observations} obtained observing the execution of an {\em unobserved} plan $\pi=\tup{a_1, \ldots, a_n}$.
\end{itemize}

A solution to $\Lambda$ is a set of operator schema $\mathcal{M}'$ compliant with the headers in $\mathcal{M}$, the predicates $\Psi$, and the state observation sequence $\mathcal{O}$. Figure~\ref{fig:lexample} shows a $\Lambda$ task for learning the {\em blocksworld} \strips\ action model from the five-state observations sequence that corresponds to inverting a 2-block tower.
