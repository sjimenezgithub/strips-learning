%% The '3p' and 'times' class options of elsarticle are used for Elsevier CRC
\documentclass[3p,times]{elsarticle}

%% The `ecrc' package must be called to make the CRC functionality available
\usepackage{ecrc}
%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Artificial Intelligence}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.
\jid{procs}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
\jnltitlelogo{Artificial Intelligence}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.

\begin{abstract}
  This paper presents a novel approach for learning \strips\ action models from observations of plan executions that compiles this learning task into classical planning. The compilation approach is flexible to various amount and kind of available input knowledge; learning examples can range from plans (with their corresponding initial state) to sequences of state observations or even just a set of initial and final states (where no intermediate action/state is known). The compilation accepts also partially specified action models and can be used to validate whether the observation of a plan execution follows a given \strips\ action model, even if this model is not fully specified. What is more, the compilation is extensible to assess how well a given \strips\ action model matches an observation of a plan execution. This extension is relevant since it allows us to evaluate the quality of the learned models with respect to the true models but also with respect to test sets of observations of plan executions, which is useful when the actual models are not available. The empirical performance of our compilation approach is evaluated learning action models for a wide range of classical planning domains from the International Planning Competition (IPC) and using these two evaluation approaches.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Section9}
We presented a novel approach for learning \strips\ action models from examples using classical planning. The approach is flexible to various amount and kind of input knowledge and accepts partially specified action models. Unlike extensive-data ML approaches, our work explores an alternative research direction to learn sound models from very small data sets. The action models of the {\em blocksworld} or {\em gripper} domains were perfectly learned from only 25 state observations. Moreover, in 12 out of the 15 domains, the learned models yield {\em Precision} values over $0.75$.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on learning \strips\ action models from state observations, using exclusively an {\em off-the-shelf} classical planner, and evaluated over a wide range of different domains. Recently, the work in~\cite{SternJ17} proposes a planning compilation for learning action models from plan traces following the {\em finite domain} representation for the state variables. This is a theoretical study on the boundaries of the learned models and no experimental results are reported.

We also introduced the {\em precision} and {\em recall} metrics, widely used in ML, for evaluating the learned action models with respect to a given reference model. These two metrics measure the soundness and completeness of the learned models and facilitate the identification of model flaws.

When example plans are available, we can compute accurate action models from small sets of learning examples in little computation time, less than a second. In many applications, the actual actions executed by the observed agent are not available but, instead, the resulting states can be observed. With this regard, we extended our approach for learning also from state observations as it broadens the range of application to external observers and facilitates the representation of imperfect observability, as shown in plan recognition \cite{SohrabiRU16}, as well as learning from unstructured data, like state images \cite{AsaiF18}. When action plans are not available, our approach still produces action models that are compliant with the input information. In this case, since learning is not constrained by actions, operators can be reformulated changing their semantics, in which case the comparison with a reference model turns out to be tricky.

We also introduced a semantic method for evaluating the learned \strips\ action models with respect to observations of plan executions. Generating {\em informative} examples for learning planning action models is still an open issue. Planning actions include preconditions that are only satisfied by specific sequences of actions which have low probability of being chosen by chance~\cite{fern2004learning}. The success of recent algorithms for exploring planning tasks~\cite{FrancesRLG17} motivates the development of novel techniques that enable to autonomously collect informative learning examples. The combination of such exploration techniques with our learning approach is an appealing research direction that opens up the door to the bootstrapping of planning action models.
