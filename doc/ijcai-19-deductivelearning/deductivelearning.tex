\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The specification of planning action models is a complex task, even for planning experts, which frequently causes a knowledge acquisition bottleneck that limits the potential of AI planning~\cite{kambhampati:modellite:AAAI2007}. The {\em machine learning} of action models aims to relieve this knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Nowadays there is a wide range of different approaches for learning planning action models~\cite{arora:amodels:ker2018}. However, most of these approaches aim maximizing some measure of {\em statistical consistency} over large sets of input examples that typically are sequential plans.

{\em Classical planning} is an interesting approach for learning \strips\ action models since it is flexible to different kinds of input knowledge (e.g., partially/fully observations of actions of plan executions as well as partially/fully observed intermediate states) and guaranttees to output an action model that is {\em consistent} with the input knowledge~\cite{aineto2018learning}. In this paper we show that this flexibility of the compilation approach goes one step further since it also allows learning from {\em state-invariants}, logic formulae that constrain the set of possible states of a given domain. The experimental results show that {\em state-invariants} boost the performance of the {\em classical planing} compilation for learning \strips\ action models.



\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
This section formalizes the {\em classical planning model} we follow in this work and the kind of {\em knowledge} that can be given as input to the task of learning \strips\ action models.  

\subsection{Classical planning with conditional effects}
Let $F$ be the set of  propositional state variables ({\em fluents}) describing a state. A {\em literal} $l$ is a valuation of a fluent $f\in F$; i.e. either~$l=f$ or $l=\neg f$. A set of literals $L$ represents a partial assignment of values to fluents (without loss of generality, we will assume that $L$ does not contain conflicting values). Given $L$, let $\neg L=\{\neg l:l\in L\}$ be its complement. We use $\mathcal{L}(F)$ to denote the set of all literal sets on $F$; i.e.~all partial assignments of values to fluents. A {\em state} $s$ is a full assignment of values to fluents; $|s|=|F|$.

A {\em classical planning action} $a\in A$ has: a precondition $\pre(a)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, a set of effects $\eff(a)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, and a positive action cost $cost(a)$. The semantics of actions $a\in A$ is specified with two functions: $\rho(s,a)$ denotes whether action $a$ is {\em applicable} in a state $s$ and $\theta(s,a)$ denotes the {\em successor state} that results of applying action $a$ in a state $s$. Then, $\rho(s,a)$ holds iff $\pre(a)\subseteq s$, i.e.~if its precondition holds in $s$. The result of executing an applicable action $a\in A$ in a state $s$ is a new state $\theta(s,a)=(s\setminus \neg\eff(a))\cup\eff(a)$. Subtracting the complement of $\eff(a)$ from $s$ ensures that $\theta(s,a)$ remains a well-defined state. The subset of action effects that assign a positive value to a state fluent is called {\em positive effects} and denoted by $\eff^+(a)\in \eff(a)$ while $\eff^-(a)\in \eff(a)$ denotes the {\em negative effects} of an action $a\in A$.

A {\em classical planning problem} is a tuple $P=\tup{F,A,I,G}$, where $I$ is the initial state and $G\in\mathcal{L}(F)$ is the set of goal conditions over the state variables. A {\em plan} $\pi$ is an action sequence $\pi=\tup{a_1, \ldots, a_n}$, with $|\pi|=n$ denoting its {\em plan length} and $cost(\pi)=\sum_{a\in\pi} cost(a)$ its {\em plan cost}. The execution of $\pi$ on the initial state of $P$ induces a {\em trajectory} $\tau(\pi,P)=\tup{s_0, a_1, s_1, \ldots, a_n, s_n}$ such that $s_0=I$ and, for each {\small $1\leq i\leq n$}, it holds $\rho(s_{i-1},a_i)$ and $s_i=\theta(s_{i-1},a_i)$. A plan $\pi$ solves $P$ iff the induced {\em trajectory} $\tau(\pi,P)$ reaches a final state $G \subseteq s_n$, where all goal conditions are met. A solution plan is {\em optimal} iff its cost is minimal.

We also define {\em actions with conditional effects} because they are useful to compactly formulate our approach for {\em goal recognition with unknown domain models}. An action $a_c\in A$ with conditional effects is a set of preconditions $\pre(a_c)\in\mathcal{L}(F)$ and a set of {\em conditional effects} $\cond(a_c)$. Each conditional effect $C\rhd E\in\cond(a_c)$ is composed of two sets of literals: $C\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, the {\em condition}, and $E\in\mathcal{L}(F)$, the {\em effect}. An action $a_c$ is applicable in a state $s$ if $\rho(s,a_c)$ is true, and the result of applying action $a_c$ in state $s$ is $\theta(s,a_c)=\{s\setminus\neg\eff_c(s,a)\cup\eff_c(s,a)\}$ where $\eff_c(s,a)$ are the {\em triggered effects} resulting from the action application (conditional effects whose conditions hold in $s$):
\[
\eff_c(s,a)=\bigcup_{C\rhd E\in\cond(a_c),C\subseteq s} E,
\]

\subsection{The observation model}
Given a planning problem $P=\tup{F,A,I,G}$, a plan $\pi$ and a trajectory $\tau(\pi,P)$, we define the \emph{observation of the trajectory} as an interleaved combination of actions and states that represents the observation from the execution of $\pi$ in $P$. Formally, $\mathcal{O}(\tau)=\tup{s_0^o,a_1^o,s_1^o \ldots , a_l^o, s_m^o}$, $s_0^o=I$, and:

\begin{itemize}
\item The {\bf observed actions} are consistent with $\pi$, which means that $\tup{a_1^o, \ldots, a_l^o}$ is a sub-sequence of $\pi$. The number of observed actions, $l$, ranges from $0$ (fully unobserved action sequence) to $|\pi|$ (fully observed action sequence).
\item The {\bf observed states} $\tup{s_0^o, s_1^o, \ldots, s_m^o}$ is a sequence of possibly {\em partially observable states}, except for the initial state $s_0^o$, which is fully observed. A partially observable state $s_i^o$ is one in which $|s_i^o| < |F|$; i.e., a state in which at least a fluent of $F$ is not observable. Note that this definition also comprises the case $|s_i^o| = 0$, when the state is fully unobservable. Whatever the sequence of observed states of $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ is, it must be consistent with the sequence of states of $\tau(\pi,P)$, meaning that $\forall i, s_i^o \subseteq s_i$. The number of observed states, $m$, range from 1 (the initial state, at least), to $|\pi|+1$, and each {\em observed} states comprises $[1,|F|]$ fluents (the observation can still miss intermediate states that are {\em unobserved}).
\end{itemize}

We assume a bijective monotone mapping between actions/states of trajectories and observations~\cite{ramirez2009plan}, thus also granting the inverse consistency relationship (the trajectory is a superset of the observation). Therefore, transiting between two consecutive observed states in $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ may require the execution of more than a single action ($\theta(s_i^o,\tup{a_1,\ldots,a_k})=s_{i+1}^o$, where ${\small k\geq 1}$ is unknown but finite. In other words, having an input observation $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ does not imply knowing the actual length of $\pi$.

\subsection{State-invaraints}
The notion of {\em state-constraint} is very general and has been used in different areas of AI and for different purposes.  If we restrict ourselves to planning, {\em state-constraints} are abstractions for compactly specifying sets of states. For instance, {\em state-constraints} in planning allow to specify the set of states where a given action is applicable, the set of states where a given {\em derived predicate} holds or the set of states that are considered goal states.

{\em State invariants} is a kind of state-constraints useful for computing more compact state representations~\cite{helmert2009concise} or making {\em satisfiability planning} and {\em backward search} more efficient~\cite{rintanen2014madagascar,alcazar2015reminder}. Given a classical planning problem $P=\tup{F,A,I,G}$, a {\em state invariant} is a formula $\phi$ that holds at the initial state of a given classical planning problem, $I\models \phi$, and at every state $s$, built from $F$, that is reachable from $I$ by applying actions in $A$.

The formula $\phi_{I,A}^*$ represents the {\em strongest invariant} and exactly characterizes the set of all states reachable from $I$ with the actions in $A$. For instance Figure~\ref{fig:strongest-invariant} shows five clauses that define the {\em strongest invariant} for the {\em blocksworld} planning domain~\cite{slaney2001blocks}. There are infinitely many strongest invariants, but they are all logically equivalent, and computing the strongest invariant is PSPACE-hard (as hard as testing plan existence~\cite{bylander:complexity:AIJ1994}).

\end{figure}


A {\em mutex} (mutually exclusive) is a state invariant that takes the form of a binary clause and indicates a pair of different properties that cannot be simultaneously true~\cite{kautz:mutex:IJCAI1999}. For instance in a three-block {\em blocksworld}, $\phi_1=\neg on(block_A,block_B)\vee \neg on(block_A,block_C)$ is a mutex because $block_A$ can only be on top of a single block.

A {\em domain invariant} is an instance-independent invariant, i.e. holds for any possible initial state and set of objects. Therefore, if a given state $s$ holds $s\nvDash \phi$ such that $\phi$ is a {\em domain invariant}, it means that $s$ is not a valid state. Domain invariants are often compactly defined as {\em lifted invariants} (also called schematic invariants)~\cite{rintanen:schematicInvariants:AAAI2017}. For instance, $\phi_2=\forall x:\ (\neg handempty\vee \neg holding(x))$, is a {\em domain mutex} for the {\em blocksworld} because the robot hand is never empty and holding a block at the same time.



\section{Learning action models from {\em state-invaraints}}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We define the task of learning action models as a tuple $\Lambda=\tup{M,\Phi,\mathcal{O}(\tau)}$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $M$ is the {\em space of possible action model}. This set is the {\em full} space of action models, when learning from scratch, or {\em partially specified}, when some fragments of the action models are known a priori. A set of action models can be defined {\em explicitly}, enumerating all the models that belong to the set or {\em implicitly}, enumerating all the constraints that must satisfy any model that belongs to the set. A {\em partially specified} \strips\ action model is then a formalism for the {\em implicit} representation of a set of \strips\ schemes~\cite{sreedharan2018handling}. 
\item $\Phi$, a set of {\em state-invariants} that constrain the set of possible states in the given domain.
\item $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ is an observation of a trajectory $\tau(\pi,P)$ produced by the execution of an unknown plan $\pi$ that solves $P_\mathcal{O}$ (i.e. the classical planning problem $P_\mathcal{O}=\tup{F,A[\cdot],s_0^o,s_m^o}$ where $A[\cdot]$ is a set of actions s.t., the semantics of each action $a\in A[\cdot]$ is unknown since functions $\rho$ and/or $\theta$ of $a$ are undefined). 
\end{itemize}

A {\em solution} to a $\Lambda=\tup{M,\Phi,\mathcal{O}(\tau)}$ learning task is a model $\mathcal{M}'\in M$ that is {\em consistent} with the given input knowledge $\Phi$ and $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$. This means that let there exists a plan $\pi$ such that the observation $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ is consistent with $\pi$ when the dynamics of $A[\cdot]$ is given by $\mathcal{M}'\in M$ and such that any state produced in the trajectory $\tau(\pi,P_\mathcal{O})$ satisfies the {\em state-invariants} $\Phi$. 

Next we show that the set $M$ of possible action models can be encoded as a set of propositional variables and a set of constraints over those variables. Then, we show how to exploit this encoding to solve the $\Lambda=\tup{M,\Phi,\mathcal{O}(\tau)}$ learning task with an off-the-shelf classical planner.


\subsection{A propositional encoding for the space of STRIPS action models}
{\em A \strips\ action schema} $\xi$ is defined by four lists: A list of {\em parameters} $pars(\xi)$, and three list of predicates (namely $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$) that shape the kind of fluents that can appear in the {\em preconditions}, {\em negative effects} and {\em positive effects} of the actions induced from that schema. Let be $\Psi$ the set of {\em predicates} that shape the propositional state variables $F$, and a list of {\em parameters} $pars(\xi)$. The set of elements that can appear in $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$ of the \strips\ action schema $\xi$ is given by FOL interpretations of $\Psi$ over the parameters $pars(\xi)$ and is denoted as ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$.

For instance in a four-operator {\em blocksworld}~\cite{slaney2001blocks}, the ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ set contains only five elements for the {\small \tt pickup($v_1$)} schemata, ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,pickup}$={\small\tt\{handempty, holding($v_1$), clear($v_1$), ontable($v_1$), on($v_1,v_1$)\}} while it contains eleven elements for the {\small \tt stack($v_1$,$v_2$)} schemata, ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,stack}$={\small\tt\{handempty, holding($v_1$), holding($v_2$), clear($v_1$), clear($v_2$), ontable($v_1$), ontable($v_2$), on($v_1,v_1$), on($v_1,v_2$), on($v_2,v_1$), on($v_2,v_2$)\}}. 

Despite any element of ${\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ can {\em a priori} appear in the $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$ of schema $\xi$, the actual space of possible \strips\ schemata is bounded by constraints of three kinds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Syntactic constraints}. \strips\ constraints require $del(\xi)\subseteq pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)\cap add(\xi)=\emptyset$ and $pre(\xi)\cap add(\xi)=\emptyset$. Considering exclusively these syntactic constraints, the size of the space of possible \strips\ schemata is given by $2^{2\times|{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}|}$. {\em Typing constraints} are also of this kind~\cite{mcdermott1998pddl}. 
\item {\bf Domain-specific constraints}. One can introduce domain-specific knowledge to constrain further the space of possible schemata. For instance, in the {\em blocksworld} one can argue that {\small\tt on($v_1$,$v_1$)} and {\small\tt on($v_2$,$v_2$)} will not appear in the $pre(\xi)$, $del(\xi)$ and $add(\xi)$ lists of an action schema $\xi$ because, in this specific domain, a block cannot be on top of itself. {\it State invariants} are also constraints of this kind. 
\item {\bf Observation constraints}. An observation $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ depicts {\em semantic knowledge} that constraints further the space of possible action schemata.   
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

In this work we introduce a propositional encoding of the {\em preconditions}, {\em negative}, and {\em positive} effects of a \strips\ action schema $\xi$ using only fluents of two kinds {\tt\small pre\_e\_$\xi$} and {\tt\small eff\_e\_$\xi$} (where $e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$). This encoding exploits the syntactic constraints of \strips\, so it is more compact that the one previously proposed by~\citeauthor{aineto2018learning}~\citeyear{aineto2018learning} for learning classical planning action models. In more detail, if {\tt\small pre\_e\_$\xi$} holds it means that $e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ is a {\em precondition} in $\xi$. If {\tt\small pre\_e\_$\xi$} and {\tt\small eff\_e\_$\xi$} holds it means that $e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ is a {\em negative effect} in $\xi$ while if $pre\_e\_\xi$ does not hold but {\tt\small eff\_e\_$\xi$} holds, it means that $e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ is a {\em positive effect} in $\xi$. Figure~\ref{fig:propositional} shows the PDDL encoding of the {\tt\small stack(?v1,?v2)} schema and our propositional representation for this same schema with {\tt\small pre\_e\_stack} and {\tt\small eff\_e\_stack} fluents ($e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,stack}$).


\subsection{Learning \strips\ action models with classical planning}
Given a $\Lambda=\tup{M,\Phi,\mathcal{O}(\tau)}$ where $\Phi$ is a set of {\em domain mutex} $\phi\in\Phi$, we create a classical planning problem $P'=\tup{F',A',I,G}$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $F'$ extends $F$ with a fluent $mode_{insert}$, to indicate whether action models are being programmed, and the fluents for the propositional encoding of the corresponding space of STRIPS action models. This is a set of fluents of the type $\{pre\_e\_\xi, eff\_e\_\xi\}_{\forall e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}}$ such that $e\in{\mathcal I}_{\Psi,\xi}$ is a single element from the set of FOL interpretations of predicates $\Psi$ over the corresponding action parameters $pars(\xi)$. 

\item $A'$ replaces the actions in $A$ with two types of actions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Actions for {\em inserting} a {\em precondition}, {\em positive} effect or {\em negative} effect in $\xi$ following the syntactic constraints of \strips\ models. In the particular case that $M$ is a {\em partially specified model} then only the actions for inserting a possible {\em precondition} or {\em effect} are necessary.
\begin{itemize}
\item Actions which support the addition of a {\em precondition} $p\in \Psi_{\xi}$ to the action model $\xi$. A precondition $p$ is inserted in $\xi$ when neither $pre_p$, $eff_p$ exist in $\xi$.

\begin{small}
\begin{align*}
\hspace*{7pt}\pre(\mathsf{insertPre_{p,\xi}})=&\{\neg pre_{p}(\xi), \neg eff_{p}(\xi), mode_{insert}\},\\
\cond(\mathsf{insertPre_{p,\xi}})=&\{\emptyset\}\rhd\{pre_{p}(\xi)\}.
\end{align*}
\end{small}

\item Actions which support the addition of a {\em negative} or {\em positive} effect $p\in \Psi_{\xi}$ to the action model $\xi$. 

\begin{small}
\begin{align*}
\hspace*{7pt}\pre(\mathsf{insertEff_{p,\xi}})=&\{\neg eff_{p}(\xi), mode_{insert}\},\\
\cond(\mathsf{insertEff_{p,\xi}})=&\{\emptyset\}\rhd\{eff_{p}(\xi)\}.
\end{align*}
\end{small}
\end{itemize}

\item Actions for {\em applying} an action model $\xi$ built by the {\em insert} actions and bounded to objects $\omega\subseteq\Omega^{|pars(\xi)|}$ (where $\Omega$ is the set of {\em objects} used to induce the fluents $F$ by assigning objects in $\Omega$ to the $\Psi$ predicates and $\Omega^k$ is the $k$-th Cartesian power of $\Omega$). The action parameters, $pars(\xi)$, are bound to the objects in $\omega$ that appear in the same position.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{small}
\begin{align*}
\pre(\mathsf{apply_{\xi,\omega}})=&\{pre_{p}(\xi)\implies p(\omega)\}_{\forall p\in\Psi_\xi},\\
\cond(\mathsf{apply_{\xi,\omega}})=&\{pre_{p}(\xi)\wedge eff_{p}(\xi)\}\rhd\{\neg p(\omega)\}_{\forall p\in\Psi_\xi},\\
&\{\neg pre_{p}(\xi)\wedge eff_{p}(\xi)\}\rhd\{p(\omega)\}_{\forall p\in\Psi\xi}\},\\
&\{\emptyset\}\rhd\{\neg mode_{insert}\}.
\end{align*}
\end{small}
















{\em domain mutex} are useful to reduce the amount of applicable actions for programming a precondition or an effect for a given action schema. For example given the {\em domain mutex} $\phi=(\neg f_1\vee \neg f_2)$ such that $f_1\in F_v(\xi)$ and $f_2\in F_v(\xi)$, we can redefine the corresponding programming actions for {\bf removing} the {\em precondition} $f_1\in F_v(\xi)$ from the action schema $\xi\in\mathcal{M}$ as:
